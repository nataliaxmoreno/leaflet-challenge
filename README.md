The dashboard can be accessed using this [link to my deployed webpage](https://nataliaxmoreno.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)
## DataSet
Earthquake data for the last 7 days is used for the visualization. The data is taken as a JSON format from the USGS, which is updated every 5 minutes.


## Visualization
Creating a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The visualzation includes

Data markers which reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

A legend that will provide context for your map data.
